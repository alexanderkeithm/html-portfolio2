<h1>The Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</h3>
<p>Great practical effects and camera techniques. Grotesque horror with an Industrial soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Battle Royale</h3>
<p>Intense movie with a very strong message. It's an emotional rollercoaster.</p>
<h3>Mandy</h3>
<p>Trippy visuals and dreamlike plot. Nicholas Cage acts like a lunatic. </p>
